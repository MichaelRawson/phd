# Literature

Overview of literature I found useful.
Will use in my literature review later.

## Papers

- [Deep Network Guided Proof Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06972.pdf) - runing a deep neural network in E to select processed clauses.
- [Machine Learning and Automated Theorem Proving](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-792.pdf) - James P. Bridge's PhD thesis, kind of what I'm aiming for, but with more of a Bayesian twist.
- [Deep Sequence Models for Premise Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04442.pdf) - selecting premises from the Mizar corpus with deep recurrent/convolutional nets.
- [_MaLeS_: A Framework for Automatic Tuning of Automated Theorem Provers](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10817-015-9329-1.pdf) - automatic strategy selection, and how to identify strategies. Still appears to be Bayesian.
- [Automated Invention of Strategies and Term Orderings for Vampire](http://arxiv.org/pdf/) - add term orderings into the mix for the possible strategy space. Unpublished.
