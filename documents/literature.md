# Literature

Overview of literature I found useful.
Will use in my literature review later.

## Papers

- [Deep Network Guided Proof Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06972.pdf) - runing a deep neural network in E to select processed clauses.
- [Machine Learning and Automated Theorem Proving](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-792.pdf) - James P. Bridge's PhD thesis, kind of what I'm aiming for, but with more of a Bayesian twist.
- [Deep Sequence Models for Premise Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04442.pdf) - selecting premises from the Mizar corpus with deep recurrent/convolutional nets.
- [_MaLeS_: A Framework for Automatic Tuning of Automated Theorem Provers](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10817-015-9329-1.pdf) - automatic strategy selection, and how to identify strategies. Still appears to be Bayesian.
- [Automated Invention of Strategies and Term Orderings for Vampire](http://arxiv.org/pdf/) - add term orderings into the mix for the possible strategy space. Unpublished.
- [Learning-Assisted Automated Reasoning with Flyspeck](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10817-014-9303-3.pdf) - actually largely about HOL->FOL translation and premise-selection, here to avoid reading it again due to the slightly-misleading title.
- [Monte-Carlo Tableaux Proof Search](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/users/cek/docs/17/mfckju-cade17.pdf) - describes implementing MCTS (as used in e.g. _AlphaGo_) in the context of LeanCOP, a tableaux prover.
- [Proof Search in the Sequent Calculus for First-Order Logic with Equality] - Arno Ehle's MSc thesis, not research-level but useful as implementation guide for sequent calculus.
